We're drowning in stuff these days. From toys and games, to new gadgets and shiny objects, it seems that we‚Äôre constantly being pulled in a million directions to buy all the things. For us as a family, it became really overwhelming. But it's an easy fix. Stop buying stuff, and get rid of your existing stuff.

Easier said than done tough, right? We seem to have this intimate bond with material objects. For most, it's a sentimental thing. For others, it may bring back old memories. Whatever the case may be, we seem to have a really hard time getting rid of things.

My wife starting bagging up toys by the garbage bag when the kids weren't looking. As we got rid of more stuff, we became happier. It felt like a weight was lifted off of our shoulders. The funny part is that they didn't even miss what was gone! These days we're all on the same page, and our kids are content with books, and living life.

The point I'm trying to make, is that we take this same approach in everything we do with SportKeeper. From building workflows to dropdown menus, and marketing pages, a lot of thought is put into making things as simple as possible. We want you to feel refreshed when running your gym, and not weighed down by micro-managing your current software.

At the end of the day, when you lock up and go home, you'll rest easy knowing that your gym or studio is in great hands, with a company that's passionate about delivering simple, but powerful gym management software.
