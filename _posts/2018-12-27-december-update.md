It seems like most software companies require you to fill out a form just to see a demo. If it's not a form, it's a button with a label that reads something like "request a demo." Well, I don't know about you, but for me personally I think it's completely unnecessary. These types of funnels exist because most of the time it's not just about the demo, it's about selling you the value of the software because it's otherwise complex upon first impression.

We're taking a completely different approach. We built a demo full of test data so you can get a good idea of how the platform will feel in live conditions. Dive in within a couple clicks. No emails. No sales funnels. No "request a demo" button.

Our goal is to build software that's not only beautiful, but intuitive to use. There's power in simplicity. When you take the demo for a test drive, we hope you'll agree.
