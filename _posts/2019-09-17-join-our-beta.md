Holy smokes it's been seven months since the last update which is just crazy! Three months ago we decided to leave our cabin the mountains and travel full time in our motorhome. We‚Äôve been learning and adjusting to a life of full time travel, while at the same time still responding to folks interested in SportKeeper.

I've got the hang of things now and have some exciting updates in the works. O.K., maybe not totally "exciting" per-se, mostly bug fixes, security updates, and API changes.

Which reminds me, did you know that the beta is open and available? It's true! SportKeeper is ready for use, but we're still looking for gyms to give it a shot. I'm here and standing by to fix things as they come up, and answer any questions you might have, so hop on over to [this page](https://sport-keeper.com/beta) and let me know if you're interested!

As always, you can email me directly at [justin@sport-keeper.com](mailto:justin@sport-keeper.com) if you have any thoughts, questions, or otherwise.
