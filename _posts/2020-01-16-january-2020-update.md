It's been nearly three months since the last update, so I figured I'd touch on a few new features that have been shipped.

###### **Mailchimp Tagging**
SportKeeper will now [apply tags to your members](https://docs.sport-keeper.com/components/members/mailchimp) when they start a membership. This is a powerful feature to enable targeted marketing! You can manage the members tags right inside the app when viewing a customer in SportKeeper.

###### **Passwordless Login**
You can now login to your SportKeeper Account and your Staff Account with an email. The option has been added as a link to both login screens. 

###### **Day Passes**
Added the ability to create and sell [day passes](https://docs.sport-keeper.com/guides/selling-day-passes). This includes support for adding multiple customers, which is a really handy feature when you have multiple people in a group under one day pass card.

###### **Customer Documents**
You can now upload documents to individual customers. This is designed to accommodate certifications that can be scanned in and now attached to a specific customer.

Other small updates and improvements:
-Added checkbox options for belay and lead certifications to members
-Real-time check in notifications now display across the app and include whether or not the member is certified in belay or lead
-Added support for archiving a product

There's a lot more still coming so stay tuned!
